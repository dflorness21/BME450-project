## Project decription

Using the [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) which provides a large collection of standarized biomedical images we want to dive into the difference of classification models depending on the sample size by looking at three different classification cases Kidney Cortex Microscope (TissueMNIST, 200k samples), Dermatoscope (DermaMNIST, 10k samples), Retinal OCT (OCTMNIST, 100k samples).


We are looking to classify skin diseases using Dermatoscopic images from the MedMNIST dataset which provides a standarised collection of biomedical images.
