Classifications of skin lesions using dermatoscopic images from the DermaMNIST dataset, a dataset found in a large-scale MNIST-like collection of standardized biomedical images, provided by some universities. It's underlying focus is on melanoma detection (a kind of skin cancer).

## Installation and Requirements

To run the code, set up the required environments and install `medmnist` as outlined in the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST), e.g. with the following command
```
pip install medmnist
```
The following packages are also necessary `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `matplotlib` and `tqdm`.
